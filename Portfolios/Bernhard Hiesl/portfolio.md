# Portfolio for H&B Automation

## Introduction
I'm Bernhard I did the bachelor in mobile computing and the reason why i started studying is because i wanted to learn how to develop applications and all the stuff around it.

### Expectations of class
I've already heard some stuff about home and building automation, for example making home automation application with an raspberry pi.
Or kinda google home or something like that. House control application with speech control.

### Pros
Good ideas
good design skills
even if i'm not the best in programming i can understand and can discuss hard problems

### Cons
not really the motivation in person

## Problems & Lessons Learned
### SSH
I had some problems with the SSH connection to git. I cloned the github repository with the HTTP link not with the SSH link. After creating, adding and using the SSH stuff everything now is working. I've also helped my colleagues to setup this settings.

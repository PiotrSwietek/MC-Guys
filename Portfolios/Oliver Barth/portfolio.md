# Portfolio - Home and Building Automation
## Mobile Computing Master - SS 2018


## whoami
My name is Oliver Barth. I come from small town called Vorderwei√üenbach (30km north to Linz). I did my Bachelor in Mobile Computing in 2017 and currently running the Mobile Computing Master Program.
* Why in this master program?
Lot of modules to choose from, program with the most interesting lectures (in my opinion).

* Expectations H&B?
Do (and see) some cool projects. Understand what's behind the scenes (sensors, actors, architecture, ...)

* Strength/weakness myself?
Strength: Quite good at bringing a project to code (paper).
Weakness: Not that creative, hate writing documentations (especially if has to happen afterwards).

## Video session
* Scenarios
Big bang theory: typical home automation
Siemens: life in the future, space control, intelligent routing, energy efficiency, security
* Technology
Big bang theory: Satellite, smartphone, laptop
Siemens: interactive hologram, light barriers for entry policy (open door principle), plug-in of whole room, distributed grid (intelligent network), personal navigation (smartphone, walls), intelligent light (different modes) e.g. for emergency, interactive floor to mark traces, IT-backbone for clustering buildings
Internet of shrimps: voice control
* Feasibility
Big bang theory: using satellite for home automation (too expensive)
Siemens: no interactive hologram in time
* Weirdness/craziness
Big bang theory: remote switch for lightning, sending signal all over the world,
Siemens: controlling/monitoring everything (privacy concerns), movable offices

## Internet of things
* What does the Inernet of Things entail?
"The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data" - Wikipedia

* Provide 3 domains
Agriculture
Smart factory
Medical and health care
Assisted living

* Provide 2 typical devices (appliance or controller)
micro-controller (arduino), smartphones, smart watches, trackers,  hue light bulb from Phillips, ...

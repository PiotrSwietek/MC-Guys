# Portfolio for H&B Automation class

## Introduction

My name is Denis and I'm studying Mobile Computing because I like computers and I fell into the "mobile generation" 
so I thought it would be a good idea.
I'm expecting/hoping to learn which devices/controllers are used, how they work and communicate and especially how to work
with Raspberry PIs because I have never used them before. Also H&B automation is getting more and more attention these days 
so I thought it would be kind of important to take this class.

## Summaries of the shown videos

### Video 1: Big Bang Theory Snippet

_Scenarios and application domains:_
	* Control Lights, Stereo, RC vehicles
	* (Public) Access over internet

What not?
	* Everything shown is possible up to date.

_Weirdness/Crazyness:_
	* Doing it "just because they can".
